# TeeRexStore

A t-shirt shopping website. It is a sample website to showcase my skills.
The task is taken from Greektrust coding challenge. Here[https://www.geektrust.com/coding/detailed/teerex-store] is the description of the task, rules, api, mockup etc.

1. Vite + React + Typescript
2. Eslint, prettier
3. Filters: Dynamically setting filters on page load. This is ok in this case there is no pagination. In real scenario, it should come from API.
